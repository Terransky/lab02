  <p>My name is Anthony Turinski. I've attended a couple colleges but only managed to snag an Associate's Degree thus far. I've worked odd jobs over my lifetime but nothing especially worth talking about. My goal right now is to do a bit better than basic survival, perhaps eke out a middle class existence.</p>
